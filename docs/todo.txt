get feedback from rod, see if and how he plans to use this going forward

sample
======
list available commands at cmd startup, and if not enough args give usage
remove
move
rename

setnodeprop path name value
delnodeprop path name
setnodepayload payload

link topath linktype
unlink topath linktype

setlinkprop topath name value
dellinkprop topath name
selinkpayload topath payload

tell: dump everything about the current node: path, node props, node payload, in-links, out-links, link props, link payload

search: name value -> list matching paths efficiently

validate that only valid strings become node names, no /'s allowed!

===

Write README.MD file describing the library, the tests, and the nldb.exe sample app:
how to build it, how to consume it, how to maintain it

LATER:
nodes::copy(nodeId, newParentId, newNameId)
